# Getting Started

Use our library to integrate the Cashfree Payment Gateway directly into your app using CashfreeSDK for Android. 
CashfreeSDK has been designed to offload the complexity of handling and integrating payments in your app.

The CashfreeSDK is available at a publicly hosted Github repo as an AAR (link below). Instructions on importing the lib is also provided.
